## Description

This is a password generator that allows the user to specify certain criteria for a randomly generated password. The site prompts the user how many characters they would like their password to contain. It will also determine if the user would like their password to include special characters, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and/or numbers. The generator will then create a randomly generated password based on the user's preferences.
